# React + TypeScript + Vite

Back end will use Django.

Google services for authentication and storage (may change, might want to use something other than noSQL).

This is a personal project for a PT application.

The goal behind this application will be to allow the PT to assign exercises to their clients to meet their exercise goals on training days not with the PT, and for the client to be able to both mark off what they have done, but to also add what extra exercises they have done.

Further development will include a group chage/posting forum for all PT clients to share their exercise achievements.

Additionally, goal is to create my own exercise API with {Exercise Name, Description, Body_Target/s, Visual?}

Stages are:

1. Setup a basic layout and pages (login, register, home and top/bottom bar).
2. Implement Django
3. Build from there...
